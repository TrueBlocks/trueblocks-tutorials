The Magizine Model

Magazines have exactly the same qualities as immutable data. They publish periodically. They cannot go back and correct
something previously published. They publish in chunks (issue) and collect those issues in volumes (manifests) and make
corrections via errata. And can be indexed and sliced and diced.

We should study the library science of magizine publishing. How do librarians organize magazines? How do magizines
organize themselves.

We should change our code to reflect this and suggest to the guy who's doing the EIPs that he use the magizine metaphor
over the book metaphor. Books are multi-chapter, but they are not published periodically.

We can offer Uniswap a magizine publishing model (and it should not escape our notice that magizines have subscribers).

They can:

1) provide dashboards showing all sorts of information from a raw data viewpoint -- transactions, blocks, traces, logs, neighbors, etc.
2) they can publish volumes/issues/articles/pages of downloadable data via the Unchained Index
